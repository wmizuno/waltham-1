/** \class wth_connection
 *
 * \brief A Waltham connection
 *
 * This represents the TCP connection carrying Waltham messages.
 *
 * A Waltham client creates a wth_connection with wth_connect_to_server().
 * A Waltham server creates a wth_connection with wth_accept().
 *
 * You set up polling with the help of wth_connection_get_fd(). When
 * the fd becomes readable, you call wth_connection_read() followed by
 * wth_connection_dispatch().
 *
 * After you have sent protocol messages, wth_connection_flush() must
 * be called to flush the messages to the network before you wait for
 * incoming messages.
 *
 * A server should not destroy a wth_connection before the client has
 * closed it, so that the TCP TIME_WAIT state is left on the client
 * system. In case of a protocol error, the server should call
 * wth_object_post_error() and wait for the client to disconnect.
 *
 * A client should do one final roundtrip before destroying a
 * wth_connection to ensure that all sent events have reached the
 * server.
 *
 * Once the connection goes into error state due to remote timeout,
 * disconnect, Waltham protocol error, or any other reason, the various
 * functions will start returning appropriate errors as described in
 * each of them.
 *
 * When the connection is specifically in protocol error state:
 * - reading will discard all incoming data
 * - dispatching will discard all pending messages and not dispatch
 * - sending messages still works
 * - flush still works
 * The protocol error state is only returned from
 * wth_connection_dispatch(), other functions will silently succeed
 * unless there are further errors.
